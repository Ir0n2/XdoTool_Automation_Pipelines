# AutoMata Pipelines + XDoTool Menu

Turn any laptop or server into a programmable **puppet user**.

Automate repetitive, GUI-based tasks without APIs, without frameworks, and without needing to know how to code.

---

## What Is This?

This project combines **two tools** that work together to automate tasks normally performed by a human using a keyboard and mouse.

- **AutoMata Pipelines** handle logic, timing, and workflow
- **XDoTool Menu** handles physical interaction with the system (typing, clicking, moving the mouse)

If a human can do it on a screen, this can automate it.

## AutoMata Pipelines

AutoMata Pipelines are **predefined workflows** (pipelines) that execute a fixed sequence of actions.

You don’t build the logic from scratch — you plug your own script, prompt, or content into an existing pipeline.

### Example Pipelines

- Automated message responses (user-provided script or AI prompt)
- AI caption generation + automatic posting
- One AI-captioned post per day
- AI posting with user-defined delays (minutes or hours)

Pipelines decide **what happens and when**.

## XDoTool

XDoTool is a command-line tool for automating:

- Keyboard input  
- Mouse movement  
- Mouse clicks  
- Window focus  

It allows software to interact with the system exactly like a real user.

---

## XDoTool Menu

XDoTool Menu is a menu-driven tool for generating Bash scripts that use XDoTool commands.

It exists for one reason:  
**Not everyone wants to write scripts by hand.**

With XDoTool Menu you can:

- Create automation scripts through a menu interface
- Automatically put a delay between commands in script to prevent errors.
- Edit scripts manually if you want (optional)

No Bash knowledge required.

## Why Use Them Together?

Separately, these tools are useful.  
Together, they remove the need for APIs entirely.

- AutoMata Pipelines define the workflow
- XDoTool Menu executes it through real GUI interaction

This makes it possible to automate software that was never meant to be automated.

## Use Cases

- Automating daily social media posts with AI-generated captions
- Turning a server or laptop into a 24/7 automated “user”
- Farming XP or currency in games
- Automatically responding to messages using AI
- Eliminating repetitive GUI-based tasks
- Abusing Crypto faucets

## Philosophy

Automation shouldn’t be gatekept.

If a human can do it with a keyboard and mouse,  
a machine should be able to do it faster, longer, and without complaining.
