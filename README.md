This is two seperate tools which can be paired together to automate menial, repititive tasks, on a laptop or server, or "puppet user" as I prefer to call it.

What is it?

AutoMata pipelines/XdoTool menu is two tools that can be paired together for automation.

What are AutoMata Pipelines? Preprogrammed workflows, an order of operations, algorithim, sequence of events, whatever the fuck you want to call it. We call it a pipeline. 
It's a predetermined series of events that you can enter your own script into. 
For example responding to messages, we got a pipeline for that where you just need to provide your script for typing in chat.
Or for using ai to generate a caption on a social media post.
  ai caption/automatic post pipeline test
  one automatically captioned post per day
  ai captioning/posting pipeline with user set delay in minutes

What is XDoTool? XdoTool is a command line tool for automating keyboard/mouse inputs.

What is The XDoTool Menu? XDoTool Menu is a tool for programming bash scripts with xDoTool commands. 
Why? I got sick of hearing people say "Well not everyone knows how to write code".

So fuck you here is a tool that does it for you. 
We give you a menu for you to create bash files and fill them with xdotool commands.
You don't have to write it yourself unless you want to. 

Paired with AutoMata Pipelines This can be used for automating almost anything.
Make Bots to farm coins and xp in a video game.
Annoy Discord users using google gemini to read texts and generate responses.
Automate daily posts on social media, with ai generated captions.
